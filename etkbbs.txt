            Description of E Toolkit documentation and samples.
            ===================================================


What is the E Toolkit?
---------------------
The E Toolkit is the powerful editor toolkit used to build EPM (the OS/2
2.x Enhanced Editor), LaMail (the OS/2 TCP/IP mail handler) and other
applications.  This package includes documentation and sample code for
version 5.51 of the toolkit.  (OS/2 2.0 shipped with version 5.50; OS/2
2.1 shipped with version 5.51, which is also in the EPMBBS package which
should be available the same place you got this package).


Important disclaimer:
---------------------
The sample code for using the current version (5.51) of the E Toolkit and
its Enhanced Multi-Line Edit control (E-MLE) is being made available for
the benefit of those who need to use it now.  It is being released "as-is",
with no promise of support, enhancement, or bug fixes.  In addition, you
should be aware that we are currently working on a new, cleaner, API
for the next major update to EPM, which is not necessarily compatible
with the one used in this package.

In mentioning the "next major update", we are not guaranteeing that this
will ever be released outside of IBM.  (That is not a decision that we can
make.)  We are currently developing EPM 5.60, which includes long line
support, pop-up menus, and much more, and EPM 6.00, which is essentially
a 32-bit version of EPM 5.60.

If you have a need to develop on top of the newer E-MLE, then please send
a note to Gennaro Cuomo (gcuomo at watson.IBM.com) describing why you need
it.  This will help us demonstrate demand for the new code, and *might*
get you on our beta-test list.
